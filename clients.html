        <li><em>Vienne Paris- I have been working with <strong>Dev after 30th</strong> from the last 4 years, a work of great professionalism and dedication. It was the best choice I made was to hand over the development part to her.</li> </em>
        <br>
    <li><em>Pura Vida- With a lot of dedication and commitment, she is able to observe the customer's need and supply beyond expectations.</em></li>

    <li><em>The People vs Coffee-I found Dev after 30th on the recommendation of a friend, my company was going through a difficult period in the development area, so I decided to hand it over to Thais and until today we have only made gains with that decision </li></em>
